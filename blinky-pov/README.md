#Light and Vision - Blinky POV
Skill level: Beginner

Another fun feature of many maker projects are LEDs - light emitting diodes. LEDs come in different sizes, and many different configurations. In this activity -- and its sister activity with the Blinky Grid -- we'll learn to program some LED arrays to display some simple graphics and messages.

##What are we playing with here?

We're going to use a BlinkyPOV, which is a row of 8 LEDs controlled by a chip and programmed to create persistence of vision images. These POV images are created when you wave the BlinkyPOV back and forth, and the board creates the illusion of messages in the air, like this:
