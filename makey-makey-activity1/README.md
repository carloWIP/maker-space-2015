#Station 1: For Beginners

The basis of many maker projects -- and all electronics! -- is circuitry. Here, we'll use a MaKey MaKey board to show you some basics of circuitry.

##What's a MaKey MaKey?
A MaKey MaKey is a circuit board that acts like a computer's keyboard and mouse. You can see on it sets of holes in directional arrows, and a couple sets marked "Click" and "Space." To these holes, you can connect alligator clips, and then when you complete a circuit by touching one of the clips, along with a clip attached to the "Earth" (or ground) section, the MaKey MaKey sends the connected keystroke to your computer.

##How's it work?
When you touch a cable connected to one of the keys and another connected to earth, you're completing a circuit, and a very small amount of electricity flows through your body -- Don't worry, it's completely safe! This completed circuit then tells the MaKey MaKey to send the keystroke to your computer.

What's cool is that you can connect the clips to anything conductive. So, for instance, you could connect the clips to bananas and make a banana keyboard!

##You try it!
Connect the clips from the MaKey MaKey to the paper clips on the project board, making sure you are making the correct connections. The "Earth" cable can clip on the side of the project board, touching the foil tape.

Once you've got that done, you can try out the MaKey MaKey Drum Machine at the link below. Be sure to come back here after you play with it a little bit! You don't want to miss out on your chance for the prizes, do you?

MaKey MaKey Drum Machine: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/2728243/

Instructions: Click the green flag to start. Touch the foil earth strip, and while doing so, touch one of the foil arrow or space pads. If you've connected things correctly, you're a musician and a maker!

##Want to win a great prize?
Now you're ready for the next-level challenge, and the chance to win a great prize like an Android tablet. Here's what you do:
- Make sure your MaKey MaKey is connected correctly
- Go to the Road Runner game: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/39005490/
- Play a few times, and see how high you can score!
- Take a picture of your high score, or get a friend to snap a photo of you playing the game, and post it to Twitter or Instagram using the hashtags #idf15 and #intelmaker.
- Don't like games? Take a video of yourself making some phat beats with the MaKey MaKey Drum Machine and upload it with the same hashtags as above!
- We'll be selecting a winner each day, and will notify you via the social media channel you posted to. Keep an eye out, you'll need to come back and claim your prize!
- Winners will be randomly selected, don't worry if you don't have the highest score!
