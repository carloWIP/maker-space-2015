#Station 5: Fun and Games!

Hopefully you've tried the other stations, now let's have some fun! We're going to use an Arduino-based game shield to play -- and make -- some games!

##What are we playing with here?

One of the great things about the Arduino community is the number of add-on boards (called shields) that have been created for it. These boards do all sorts of things to extend the basic devices' functionality. What we'll use here is a kit built around a board which turns a basic Arduino board into a handheld gaming device. While it's not going to deliver experiences quite like a Xbox or even your mobile phone, it's great for retro classics like Snake!

##How does it work?

This device is based on the [DIY Gamer Kit](https://www.techwillsaveus.com/shop/diy-kits/diy-gamer-kit-arduino/) from a company called Technology Will Save Us. It's a kit that comes with everything involved as unassembled pieces, which you then solder together, assemble and program. It's great for people just getting started, and kids will love it too! Once the unit is assembled, it's programmed via the Arduino IDE to play different games, display images and animations and more. Of course, since it's programmable, the games are reprogrammable!

##You try it!

Flip the power switch in the upper left corner of the unit. The red LED should flash a few times, then the screen should light up with an S. This means you're ready to play Snake! Hit the start button, and your snake will start roving the screen. Use the direction buttons to control it and grab your food. But be careful that you don't let the snake run into itself, that's the end of the game.

##Want to win a great prize?
- Take a few practice runs, then see how high you can score on Snake! Snap a photo of yourself with the game unit, and post the photo to Twitter or Instagram, tell us how high you scored, and tag it with #idf15 and #intelmaker.
- We'll be selecting winners at random throughout the day, and will notify you via the social media channel you posted to. Keep an eye out, you'll need to come back and claim your prize!
- Intel employees are not eligible for prizes. One prize per IDF attendee.
